# Neural Sketch project
- learning to learn sketches for programs

#TODO:
- [ ] Get regexes working 
- [ ] figure out correct objective for learning holes -completed ish
- [ ] start by training holes on pretrain
- [ ] have lower likelihood of holes
- [ ] make hole probibility vary with depth
- [ ] fuss with correct way to generate sketches
- [ ] Use more sophisticated nn architectures (perhaps only after getting RobustFill to work)
- [ ] Try other domains??
- [ ]
